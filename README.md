# First-site-in-django
Web-page development educational project

I have followed TechWithTim tutorial on Django and created this web-site with several pages in it (home page, register user, login, create ToDoList, etc).
A sidebar, Bootstrap templates and Django's inbuilt crispy_forms are used to improve functionality and look.
